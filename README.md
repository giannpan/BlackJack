# BlackJack

### 1) BlackJack Game:

The first part of the project is a classic BlackJack Game where all the decisions of hitting, standing, splitting cards and doubling down are available, while the player can adjust their bet.


### 2) Automated BlackJack Game following the same rules with the dealer:

We are trying to evaluate the final result of a play, depending on the starting hand of the player and the dealer's card if they follow the exact same strategy. So I created an automated version that is repeated for 100000 times. 


### 3) Automated BlackJack Game following specific decision making rules:

There is a famous BlackJack cheatsheet, where specific rules are applied for each combination of Players hand and Dealers hand.
A bot is created to adopt optimal strategies and outsmart the dealer. The program ran for 10 games with 1 million plays each. 

üõ†Ô∏è Tools:

All the project were developed in Python using Random library.

For the visualisations, Seaborn Library and Microsoft PowerBi were used.
